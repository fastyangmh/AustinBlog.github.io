I am Austin, with a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Information Engineer from the National Yunlin University of Science and Technology.  

I am familiar with image classification and sound recognition, and I am good at PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, and TensorFlow in the deep learning framework.  

In this blog, I will introduce deep learning, LeetCode problem, or some programming problems, and keep the notes as my programming diary.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by email. 

Thank you!
